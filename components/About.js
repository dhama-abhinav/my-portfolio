            I have always had a knack for technology and working with computers.
            In 2018 I started working with HTML and CSS to make some minor edits
            on a small business website that I was operating. What I thought was
            just a few small edits turned into a love for programming.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Fascinated with how interesting programming can be I was quickly
            drawn to learn more. I started learning javascript and was even more
            enthused with making websites interactive. I am now spending my time
            building projects with React JS,Next JS , Tailwind CSS ,Firebase,
            and learning new technologies.
